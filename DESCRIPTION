Description: Provides weighted versions of several metrics, scoring
    functions and performance measures used in machine learning, including
    average unit deviances of the Bernoulli, Tweedie, Poisson, and Gamma
    distributions, see Jorgensen B. (1997, ISBN: 978-0412997112). The
    package also contains a weighted version of generalized R-squared, see
    e.g. Cohen, J. et al. (2002, ISBN: 978-0805822236). Furthermore,
    'dplyr' chains are supported.
